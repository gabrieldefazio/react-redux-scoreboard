# react-redux-scoreboard
This app allows a user to dynamically keep track of players' score for any game that might require it. Players can be added, total points tallied, while the timer keeps track of time. The scoreboard app, inspired by a course at Team Treehouse, was created using react and react-redux to manage state.
